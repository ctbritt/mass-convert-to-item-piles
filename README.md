# Mass Convert to Item Piles
A one-click macro to convert dead NPCs to Item Piles while adding a little flash as well. Requires [Sequencer](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer) and [Item Piles](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-ItemPiles) (obviously).

Feel there's a lot of room to improve on this, or even make it a world macro that hooks into the end of combat.
